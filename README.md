# Space-exploratory-site
A project made using HTML and CSS to improve skills further 
In this project I learnt the following topics by following the course on scrimba 
# 1. Background Images-How to add background images in a website using (text shadows) property in CSS
# 2. Webp format-WE can use webp formats instead of using traditional gifs as they are smaller in size and faster in speed.
# 3. Google fonts-I added google fonts in the projects for extended library of fonts to make the site more appealing.
# 4. Span tag- Works like div tag but instead can be used to target a particular element.
Note:- Span tags are inline in nature whereas divs are block based.
# 5. IDs-Are just like classes but are used to target particular elements in whole page which will be not used again as their properties only exist to themselves only.
# 6. text-shadow: the property used to enhance the readability by adding shadows or may make the text more readable and uses 4 values:horizontal shadows,vertical shadows,blurriness and the color of the background shadow.
